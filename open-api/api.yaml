    description: |
          Methods for logging in individual users.

          These methods only apply when using Koverse's built-in user management.
  - name: Data Sets
    description: |
          Create, configure, and delete Data Sets.

  #  description: |
  #        Data Set Schemas
  - name: Data Set Attributes
    description: |
          List, inspect, and configure masking for data set attributes
  - name: Data Set Permissions
    description: |
          Control access to data in Data Sets.

          Access is controlled on a Group basis and includes actions such as writing to a Data Set, querying, deleting, changing configuration, etc.

          Note that these permissions are distinct from system permission which control things like which Groups can do things like create Data Sets, setup Transforms etc.

  - name: Indexing Policies
    description: |
          Control how Koverse indexes data in a data set.

          This includes specifying which attributes to index, how data should be tokenized, and which combinations of attributes should be combined into Composite Indexes.
          The set of available indexes affects which kinds of interactive queries Koverse can support.

      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Query
    description: |
          Interactively query Data Sets.

          Queries are designed to retrieve a specific subset of records, in many cases in less than a second.
          Applications can call query methods in response to user requests.
  - name: Records
    description: |
          Write and retrieve individual records and sets of sample records.
  - name: Source Types
    description: |
          List available Source types.
          Source types specify which parameters are available for each type of Source.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Sources
    description: |
          Sources are external data systems from which Koverse can ingest data.

      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Import Jobs
    description: |
          Import jobs are used for importing data from an external Source into a Data Set.

          These jobs are executed by the Hadoop MapReduce or Spark frameworks asynchronously.
          Note that Koverse submits jobs to YARN which then executes them according to the way the YARN cluster is configured, which is typically a single queue so jobs are started on a first come, first serve basis.
          Jobs may run simultaneously as cluster resources allow.

          Jobs can be started or shutdown via these methods.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Import Schedules
    description: |
          Manage schedules for Import Flows.

          Schedules control how Import Jobs are started automatically.
          Import Jobs can still be created for Import Flows without schedules on an on-demand basis.

  - name: Transform Types
    description: |
          Get a list of transforms available in the system.
          Transform types specify which parameters are available for each type of Transform.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Transforms
    description: |
          Setup a partiular Transform Type to transform one or more data sets into a new Data Set.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Transform Jobs
    description: |
          Transform jobs process new data or all data in input Data Sets and write out results to an output Data Set.

          These jobs are executed by the Hadoop MapReduce or Spark frameworks asynchronously.
          Note that Koverse submits jobs to YARN which then executes them according to the way the YARN cluster is configured, which is typically a single queue so jobs are started on a first come, first serve basis.
          Jobs may run simultaneously as cluster resources allow.

          Jobs can be started or shutdown via these methods.

  - name: Transform Schedules
    description: |
          Manage schedules for Transforms.

          Schedules control how Transform Jobs are started automatically.
          Transforms Jobs can still be created for Transforms without schedules on an on-demand basis, or automatically as new data is ingested via Import Jobs into input Data Sets.

  - name: Sink Types
    description: |
          List and get available Sink types.
          Sinks are external systems to which Koverse can export data.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Sinks
    description: |
          Create, update, and delete Sinks.
          Sinks are external systems to which Koverse can export data.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Export Jobs
    description: |
          Export jobs write new data or all data in input Data Sets to an external Sink.

          These jobs are executed by the Hadoop MapReduce or Spark frameworks asynchronously.
          Note that Koverse submits jobs to YARN which then executes them according to the way the YARN cluster is configured, which is typically a single queue so jobs are started on a first come, first serve basis.
          Jobs may run simultaneously as cluster resources allow.

          Jobs can be started or shutdown via these methods.

  - name: Sink Schedules
    description: |
          Manage schedules for exporting to Sinks

          Schedules control how Export Jobs are started automatically.
          Export Jobs can still be created for Sinks without schedules on an on-demand basis or automatically as new data appears in input Data Sets.
    externalDocs:
      description: "Deprecated. Please see Automation Guide for API usage."
      url: "dev/automation/automationguide.html"
  - name: Jobs
    description: |
          Start, monitor, and cancel data processing jobs.

          Data processing jobs are used for importing, transforming, and exporting data.
          These jobs are executed by the Hadoop MapReduce or Spark frameworks asynchronously.
          Koverse monitors the status of jobs, gathering information on the success or failure of a job, including gathering any error information about failed jobs.

          Jobs can be started or shutdown via these methods.
          Note that Koverse submits jobs to YARN which then executes them according to the way the YARN cluster is configured, which is typically a single queue so jobs are started on a first come, first serve basis.
          Jobs may run simultaneously as cluster resources allow.

          If two or more jobs will write on the same data set, one job may become blocked to allow the other job to complete its processing without inteference.
          In some cases a blocked job can be unblocked so it can proceed.
